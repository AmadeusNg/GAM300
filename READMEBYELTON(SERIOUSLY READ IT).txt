This is a short guide on the versioning style we shall use for this project. We will be using what is known as a pull and fork request system.
1) When you go to the repo, there will be a button on the top right hand corner called fork repository, click it.
2) Then you can keep most of the settings the same. But uncheck just wanting to copy to the main branch
3) from there you can go into your own repo, and clone the forked copy found on your profile.
4) from there anything you push only goes to your version of the repo, and you will need to formaly create a pull request to merge it to mine

IMPORTANT THINGS
1) main will always hold a backup of the latest working version
2) if you want to create your own branches in your cloned repo thats fine, but please push the branch changes to the branch that is universal to everyone then pull request it
3) ONLY WORK IN THE TESTING BRANCH
4) Thats all love yall xoxo
